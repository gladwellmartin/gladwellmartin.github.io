# Remote Sensing Image Processing and Orthophoto Mapping

## Objective
Generate accurate imagery and maps to support spatial analysis and planning.

## Your Role
- Processed multispectral and hyperspectral imagery  
- Produced orthophotos and mapping products with high accuracy  
- Supported analysis through consistent image processing and QA  

## Tools and Technologies
ERDAS IMAGINE  
ArcGIS  
QGIS  

## Workflow
- Performed image preprocessing  
- Applied radiometric and geometric corrections  
- Completed orthorectification and mosaicking  
- Produced maps and validated accuracy  

## Key Outcomes
- High-quality orthophotos suitable for analysis  
- Accurate mapping products and datasets  
- Improved reliability of imagery-based outputs
