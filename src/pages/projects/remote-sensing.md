# Remote Sensing Image Processing and Orthophoto Mapping

## Objective
Generate accurate imagery and maps to support spatial analysis and planning.

## My Role
I led the end-to-end remote sensing workflow, from raw imagery preparation through orthorectification, mosaicking, and QA/QC to produce final 
orthophotos and map-ready outputs.

Key responsibilities included:
- Organizing and validating raw imagery and project metadata
- Performing radiometric and geometric corrections
- Managing ground control inputs and orthorectification steps
- Building mosaics and seamlines for consistent final products
- Running QA/QC checks for alignment, color balance, and completeness  

## Tools and Technologies  
POSPAC 
QGIS  

## Workflow
- Performed image preprocessing  
- Applied radiometric and geometric corrections  
- Completed orthorectification and mosaicking  
- Produced maps and validated accuracy  

## Key Outcomes
- High-quality orthophotos suitable for analysis  
- Accurate mapping products and datasets  
- Improved reliability of imagery-based outputs
