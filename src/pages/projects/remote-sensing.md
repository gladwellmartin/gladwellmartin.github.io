# Remote Sensing Image Processing and Orthophoto Mapping

## Objective
Generate accurate imagery and maps to support spatial analysis and planning.

## My Role
I led the end-to-end remote sensing workflow, from raw imagery preparation through orthorectification, mosaicking, and QA/QC to produce final 
orthophotos and map-ready outputs.

Key responsibilities included:
- Organizing and validating raw imagery and project metadata
- Performing radiometric and geometric corrections
- Managing ground control inputs and orthorectification steps
- Building mosaics and seamlines for consistent final products
- Running QA/QC checks for alignment, color balance, and completeness  

## Tools and Technologies  
-POSPAC 
-QGIS  
## Tools & Technologies
- Photogrammetry software (e.g., Agisoft Metashape / Pix4D)
- QGIS / ArcGIS Pro
- Python
- GDAL
- Raster processing utilities
## Workflow
- Performed image preprocessing  
- Applied radiometric and geometric corrections  
- Completed orthorectification and mosaicking  
- Produced maps and validated accuracy  

## Key Outcomes
- Produced orthophotos suitable for engineering and planning workflows
- Improved positional accuracy across final mosaics
- Delivered consistent, QA/QC-validated raster datasets  
## Business Value
These workflows support infrastructure planning, asset management, and environmental analysis by providing reliable, spatially accurate imagery 
products.
