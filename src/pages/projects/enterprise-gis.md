## Objective
Provide a stable, scalable enterprise GIS environment and custom geospatial 
tools to support client mapping, analysis, and data integration needs.

## My Role
I designed and maintained enterprise geospatial database structures and developed automation workflows to improve performance and reliability across 
GIS systems.

Key responsibilities included:
- Designing database indexing strategies for feature classes  
- Writing Python/ArcPy scripts to automate index creation and removal  
- Supporting enterprise geodatabase performance tuning  
- Developing repeatable backend GIS maintenance tools  
- Documenting workflows and data standards

## Tools & Technologies
- ArcGIS Enterprise  
- ArcPy  
- Python  
- SQL  
- Geodatabase administration  
- Database indexing and performance tuning

## Workflow

- Performed image preprocessing
- Applied radiometric and geometric corrections
- Completed orthorectification and mosaicking
- Produced maps and validated accuracy


## Key Outcomes
- Improved enterprise geodatabase query performance through automated index management  
- Reduced manual maintenance effort by implementing repeatable Python workflows  
- Increased reliability and consistency of enterprise GIS datasets  
- Supported stable publishing and consumption of GIS services  
- Established documented standards for backend GIS data maintenance  

## Business Value
These workflows improve system performance, reduce operational risk, and ensure reliable access to enterprise GIS data that supports planning, 
engineering, and decision-making across the organization.
