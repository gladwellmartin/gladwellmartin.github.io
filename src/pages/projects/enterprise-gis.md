## Objective
Provide a stable, scalable enterprise GIS environment and custom geospatial 
tools to support client mapping, analysis, and data integration needs.

## My Role

I designed and implemented enterprise geospatial database automation workflows and developed Python-based tools to improve data performance, 
integrity, and maintenance efficiency.

Key responsibilities included:

- Designing database indexing strategies for feature classes  
- Writing ArcPy scripts to automate index creation and removal  
- Supporting enterprise geodatabase performance tuning  
- Developing repeatable tools for data maintenance tasks  
- Supporting GIS analysts and engineers with backend GIS workflows 

## Tools and Technologies
ArcGIS Enterprise  
ArcGIS Pro  
Oracle Spatial  
FME  
Python  
REST APIs  

## Workflow

- Performed image preprocessing
- Applied radiometric and geometric corrections
- Completed orthorectification and mosaicking
- Produced maps and validated accuracy


## Key Outcomes
- Improved enterprise geodatabase query performance through automated index management  
- Reduced manual maintenance effort by implementing repeatable Python-based workflows  
- Increased reliability and consistency of enterprise GIS datasets  
- Supported stable publishing and consumption of GIS services for client applications  
- Established documented standards for backend GIS data maintenance  

## Business Value
These workflows improve system performance, reduce operational risk, and ensure reliable access to enterprise GIS data that supports planning, 
engineering, and decision-making across the organization.
