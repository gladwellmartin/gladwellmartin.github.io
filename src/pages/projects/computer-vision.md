# Computer Vision: Plane Detection in Point Clouds (RANSAC)

## Overview
This project implements a Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to detect planar surfaces within 3D point cloud datasets for feature extraction 
and scene understanding.

## My Role
I implemented and tested the plane-detection workflow, including preprocessing point cloud data, fitting plane models, and evaluating inliers and 
outliers.

## Tools & Technologies
- C++
- Python
- OpenCV
- Point Cloud Library (PCL)
- NumPy

## Key Outcomes
- Detected dominant planar surfaces from noisy point cloud datasets  
- Generated plane equations and surface normals  
- Classified inliers vs outliers for each detected plane  
- Produced outputs suitable for visualization and downstream analysis  

## Business Value
Supports 3D mapping, urban modeling, and infrastructure analysis by extracting structural features from point cloud data.
