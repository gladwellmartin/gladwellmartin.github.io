# About Me

I am a healthcare data analyst and geospatial professional with over seven 
years of experience supporting government agencies, research institutions, and 
private clients.

My work focuses on building reliable enterprise GIS systems, developing 
automated data workflows, and delivering spatial analytics that support 
operational and policy decisions.

I currently work with the Colorado Department of Healthcare Policy and 
Financing, where I develop analytics and dashboards used to support Medicaid 
program monitoring and evaluation.
